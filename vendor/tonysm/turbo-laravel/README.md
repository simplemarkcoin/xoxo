## Introduction

This package gives you a set of conventions to make the most out of [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/) in Laravel.

#### Inspiration

This package was inspired by the [Turbo Rails gem](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails).

#### Bootcamp

If you want a more hands-on introduction, head out to [Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.turbo-laravel.com). It covers building a multi-platform app in Turbo.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for Turbo Laravel can be found on the [Turbo Laravel website](https://turbo-laravel.com).

## Closing Notes

Try the package out. Use your Browser's DevTools to inspect the responses. You will be able to spot every single Turbo Frame and Turbo Stream happening.
