## Fixing Laravel's Previous URL Issue

Visits from Turbo Frames will hit your application and Laravel by default keeps track of previously visited URLs to be used with helpers like `url()->previous()`, for instance. This might be confusing because chances are that you wouldn't want to redirect users to the URL of the most recent Turbo Frame that hit your app. So, to avoid storying Turbo Frames visits as Laravel's previous URL, head to the [issue](https://github.com/tonysm/turbo-laravel/issues/60#issuecomment-1123142591) where a solution was discussed.
